    Through this website, we will discuss how Estonia is one of the greatest nations in all the world when you compare it to other nations including China, North Korea, and the United States. We will see what they do well compared to places like China and the United States, but we will also see where they could do better. The main thing we will look at is their restrictions on the internet. For example, China has a lot more restrictions to the internet than many other places in the world.
