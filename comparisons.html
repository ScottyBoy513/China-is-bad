      China- China is a communist nation that is one of the most populated countries in the world. While China's economy has been expanding, they still do not have the best economy, so they try to hide that fact by censoring it on the internet. If there is any type of news that could make them look bad, they try to hide any information about it from their citizens. This will include the Tieneman Square Protest of 1989, police brutality, and food safety scandals. This shows exactly how China is not willing to be honest with itself, so it will end up just making things worse for itself. The suicide rate in China is 22.23 people out of every 100,000. This means that over 200000 people in China commit suicide each year. While their suicide rate is one of the highest in the world, they only have a 3.95% unemployment rate. China is known to try to cover incidents up, such as the Tank Man in Tieneman square. After an American journalist took a picture of this incident, the Chinese government tried to get him to delete all the photos and keep him in custody until he did so. Below is a picture of the incident which had occured in Tieneman Square.
