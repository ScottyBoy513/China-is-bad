      China- China is a communist nation that is one of the most populated countries in the world. While China's economy has been expanding, they still do not have the best economy, so they try to hide that fact by censoring it on the internet. If there is any type of news that could make them look bad, they try to hide any information about it from their citizens. This will include the Tieneman Square Protest of 1989, police brutality, and food safety scandals. This shows exactly how China is not willing to be honest with itself, so it will end up just making things worse for itself.
