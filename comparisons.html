  <h1>Other Countries</h1>

    <li>
      China- China is a communist nation that is one of the most populated countries in the world. While China's economy has been expanding, they still do not have the best economy, so they try to hide that fact by censoring it on the internet. If you are trying to find something on the internet that has been restricted by the Chinese government, they will arrest you and fine you. They are constantly monitoring their own citizens and overall internet usage, and their system is more extensive than any other country which is why it's called the Great Firewall of China. If there is any type of news that could make them look bad, they try to hide any information about it from their citizens. This will include the Tieneman Square Protest of 1989, police brutality, and food safety scandals. This shows exactly how China is not willing to be honest with itself, so it will end up just making things worse for itself. The suicide rate in China is 22.23 people out of every 100,000. This means that over 200000 people in China commit suicide each year. While their suicide rate is one of the highest in the world, they only have a 3.95% unemployment rate. China is known to try to cover incidents up, such as the Tank Man in Tieneman square. After an American journalist took a picture of this incident, the Chinese government tried to get him to delete all the photos and keep him in custody until he did so. Below is a picture of the incident which had occured in Tieneman Square.

    <li>
      United States- As a nation, the United States is far superior than China when it comes to nations of the world. The United States does limit illegal things from being on the internet, but they are not allowed to shut down opinions about how the government is doing or just general opinions. While the United States does have its fair share of problems, it also does allow a system of democracy, so it's people have a voice unlike China. The suicide rate alone is far smaller in the USA than it is in China because they're suicide rate is only about 7 people out of every 100000. The United States has a slightly higher enemployment rate at 4.3%. Compared to a communist nation like China, the United States is far superior.

    <li>
      North Korea- North Korea is just as bad as China when it comes to controlling its citizens. Just like China, North Korea will monitor what its citizens do when they're online, and they are only allowed to go where the government tells them they are allowed to go. They will restrict any influence from the outside world, and try to limit the influence other countries have on them. Unlike China though who is willing to release statistics about their country, North Korea tries to hide facts about their country even harder than China ever has.
