  <h1>One Amazing Nation</h1>
    <p>
      In Estonia, the internet is essentially a free place. It has one of the lowest restrictions in the world. While the government will still protect the rights of its citizens even on the internet, they will not actively block any websites. Through this Estonia has been allowed to have growth on the internet unlike places like China. Voting online is a common thing in Estonia. Compared to places like the US where people are allowed to vote, but not online, Estonia has a better system which allows more people to interact with the political system. In China, people aren't even allowed to vote further proving the point that the government has too much power and are oppressing its citizens. While it has a higher suicide rate than the USA, Estonia less suicides than China at 20.3 for every 100000 people. Out of the 3 countries mentioned, Estonia has the highest unemployment rate at 5.5%. While Estonia may have its faults like every other country, when it comes to the internet, it is the most free nation out of every country.
